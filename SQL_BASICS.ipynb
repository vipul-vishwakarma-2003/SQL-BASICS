        "  - mysql> create table employee\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide examples of common types of constraints.\n",
        "  - A key constraint in a Database Management System (DBMS) refers to a set of rules applied to one or more columns in a database table to ensure the uniqueness and integrity of data.\n",
        "  - EX. Primary Key, Foreign Key, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT, INDEX\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.\n",
        "  - NOT NULL constaraint ensures that the column cannot be without value you have to enter some value in it.\n",
        "  - The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an example for both adding and removing a constraint.\n",
        "  - for adding we use  Alter table_name and then we use ADD constraint, EX. Alter table employee Add primary key(col1, col2);\n",
        "  - For removing we use Alter table_name and then we use Drop function to remove any constraint, Ex. Alter table employee Drop primary key(col1);\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints. Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.\n",
        "  - Constraint violations protect the validity of the data. They prevent mistakes like:\n",
        "  - Duplicate entries where uniqueness is required\n",
        "  - Orphaned records from missing foreign key references\n",
        "  - Incomplete or illogical data entries\n",
        "  - EX. new row for relation \"employees\" violates check constraint \"employees_age_check\"\n",
